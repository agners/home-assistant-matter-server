# Home Assistant Matter Server

This project implements a Matter (formerly Home Assistant Connected Home over IP
or CHIP) WebSocket Server.

:warning: This is under development and in very early stage!

## Usage

To use the Matter Server using the Supervisor add-on is the recommended path.

## Development

The Home Assistant Matter Server uses the Python CHIP Controller part of the
open source [Matter/Project CHIP repository][project-chip].
The project offers a IPython based REPL for testing/exploring. The REPL is also
available as [Python CHIP Controller REPL Add-on][chip-controller-repl-add-on].

### Build

To build the Python CHIP Controller follow the building instructions available
at [docs/guides/python_chip_controller_building.md][python-chip-building].
Once you have a working Python CHIP Controller Python environment, switch
to this repository and install this project as follows:

```shell
pip install .
```
